# Diversity

Species diversity, in its simplest definition, is the number of species in a particular area and their relative abundance (evenness). Once we know the taxonomic composition of our metagenomes, we can do diversity analyses. Here we will discuss the two most used diversity metrics, α diversity (within one metagenome) and β (across metagenomes).

- *α* Diversity: Can be represented only as richness (, i.e., the number of different species in an environment), or it can be measured considering the abundance of the species in the environment as well (i.e., the number of individuals of each species inside the environment). To measure α-diversity, we use indexes such as Shannon’s, Simpson’s, Chao1, etc.

*Alpha diversity is calculated according to fish diversity in a pond. Here, alpha diversity is represented in its simplest way: Richness.*

In the next example, we will look at the α and the β components of the diversity of a dataset of fishes in three lakes. The most simple way to calculate the β-diversity is to calculate the distinct species between two lakes (sites). Let us take as an example the diversity between Lake A and Lake B. The number of species in Lake A is 3. To this quantity, we will subtract the number of these species that are shared with the Lake B: 2. So the number of unique species in Lake A compared to Lake B is (3-2) = 1. To this number, we will sum the result of the same operations but now take Lake B as our reference site. In the end, the β diversity between Lake A and Lake B is (3-2) + (3-2) = 2. This process can be repeated, taking each pair of lakes as the focused sites.

*Alpha and beta diversity indexes of fishes in a pond.*

- *β* diversity mesures how different two or more communities are, either in their composition (richness) or in the abundance of the organisms that compose it (abundance).

- *Bray-Curtis dissimilarity*: The difference in richness and abundance across environments (samples). Weight on abundance. Measures the differences from 0 (equal communities) to 1 (different communities)
- *Jaccard distance*: Based on the presence/absence of species (diversity). It goes from 0 (same species in the community) to 1 (no species in common)
- *UniFrac*: Measures the phylogenetic distance; how alike the trees in each community are. There are two types, without weights (diversity) and with weights (diversity and abundance)
There are different ways to plot and show the results of such analysis. Among others, PCA, PCoA, or NMDS analysis are widely used.

**Q: Which of the options below is true for the alpha diversity in lakes A, B, and beta diversity between lakes A and B, respectively?**

- 4, 3, 1
- 4, 3, 5
- 9, 7, 16


<details>
<summary>
HINT
</summary>

> 4, 3, 5 Alpha diversity in this case, is the sum of different species. Lake A has 4 different species and lake B has 3 different species. Beta diversity refers to the difference between lake A and lake B. If we use the formula in Figure 2 we can see that to calculate beta diversity, we have to detect the number of species and the number of shared species in both lakes. There is only one shared species, so we have to subtract the number of shared species to the total species and sum the result. In this case, in lake A, we have 4 different species and one shared species with lake B (4-1)=3, and in lake B we have three species and one shared species with lake A (3-1)=2. If we add 3+2, the result is 5.

## 1 Alpha diversity

A comprehensive list of global indicators of the ecosystem state can be obtained as follows. This includes various measures of richness, evenness, diversity, dominance, and rarity with default parameters. See the individual functions for more options regarding parameter tuning.
```{r lib}

library(tibble)
library(microbiome)
library(vegan)
library(FSA)

library(patchwork)
```

```{r data}
setwd("~/Metagenomics_2024/Day_2/")
merged_metagenomes <- phyloseq::import_biom("../DATA//merge_species.biom") 
meta <- read.csv(file = "../DATA/tryp_metadata.csv", sep = ",")

# Sort the 'meta' data frame by the 'SRA.identifier' column
meta <- meta %>% arrange(row_number(SRA.identifier))

# Associate the sorted metadata to the phyloseq object as sample data
merged_metagenomes@sam_data <- sample_data(meta)

# Extract the sample names from the 'meta' data frame
column_name <- meta %>% pull(Sample)

# Associate the extracted sample names to the phyloseq object
sample_names(merged_metagenomes) <- column_name

# Remove the unnecessary 'k_' prefix in the taxonomy data
merged_metagenomes@tax_table@.Data <- substring(merged_metagenomes@tax_table@.Data, 4)

# Rename the columns of the taxonomy table to represent taxonomic ranks
colnames(merged_metagenomes@tax_table@.Data) <- c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus", "Species")

#Keep only the kingdom of interest
merged_metagenomes <- subset_taxa(merged_metagenomes, Kingdom %in% c("Archaea", "Bacteria", "Fungi", "Viruses"))
head(sample_data(merged_metagenomes))
head(tax_table(merged_metagenomes))
```


```{r tab}
# Aggregate rare taxa at the Species level for the phyloseq object 'merged_metagenomes'
# Taxa are included if they have a detection threshold of 0.05% and a prevalence of 20%
pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(merged_metagenomes, level = "Species", detection = 0.05/100, prevalence = 20/100)

# Calculate the Shannon diversity index for the aggregated phyloseq object 'pseq'
# The Shannon index measures the diversity within a sample, considering both richness and evenness
tab <- microbiome::alpha(pseq, index = 'shannon')

# Display the first few rows of the calculated Shannon diversity index table
head(tab)
```
This returns observed richness with given detection threshold(s).

```{r rich}
# Calculate the richness of the phyloseq object 'pseq' with a detection threshold of 1000
# Richness is a measure of the number of different taxa present in a sample
tab <- richness(pseq, detection = 1000)

# Display the first few rows of the calculated richness table
head(tab)
```

Each of these metrics can give an insight into the distribution of the OTUs inside our samples. For example, the Chao1 diversity index gives more weight to singletons and doubletons observed in our samples, while Shannon is an entropy index remarking the impossibility of taking two reads out of the metagenome “bag” and that these two will belong to the same OTU.

**Q: What do you observe?**

###  1.1 Statistical hypothesis for alpha diversity

#### 1.1.1 Normality test: Check the Normal or not normal distribution  


Check normality of data: Shapiro Test & QQ-plots. 
Shapiro: H0 is «data follow normal distribution», H1 is «data do not follow normal distribution». 


![](https://github.com/vincentmanz/Metagenomics_2024/blob/main/Day_2/img/shap1.png)

Use the custom function indices_normality() (defined in HELPER/indices_normality.R) plots the results of Shapiro test (Theoritical Quantiles) as well as Q-Qplots.
Means if p < 0.05 -> reject the H0 (so does not follow a normal distribution)

```{r normalization_shap, eval=FALSE}

tab <- microbiome::alpha(pseq)


tab |>
  dplyr::select(observed,
                diversity_gini_simpson,
                diversity_shannon,
                chao1) |>
  indices_normality(nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

***Q: What are your conclusions?***


#### 1.1.2 Parametric (follows normal distribution) AND at least 3 groups - ANOVA test

**Q: How many groups used? See the column "Type" of metadata? or Other variables?**


<details>
<summary>
HINT
</summary>

> factor(meta$Type)

</details>  


You can use the ANOVA test to compare the means of the alpha diversity indexes between the three groups.

```{r parametric_anova}
tab <- microbiome::alpha(pseq)
metadata <- data.frame(sample_data(pseq))

aov_observed <- stats::aov(tab$diversity_shannon ~ Type, metadata)
summary(aov_observed)
```

 You are comparing the effect of 3 types of experiments. 

**Q: What are your conclusions? What is the p-value?**

It does not tell you which pair of groups are significantly differents!!!!

Post-hoc test: Tukey multiple pairwise-comparisons

```{r pval}
signif_pairgroups <- stats::TukeyHSD(aov_observed, method = "bh")
#plot(stats::TukeyHSD(aov_observed, method = "bh"))
signif_pairgroups
```

**Q: What are your conclusions?**



#### 1.1.3 Parametric (follows normal distribution) AND 2 groups - T-test

```{r parametric_ttest}
observed_ttest <- stats::t.test(tab$diversity_shannon ~ Gut, data = metadata)
observed_ttest
```

**Q: What are your conclusions?**

#### 1.1.4 Non-parametric (do not follows normal distribution) AND at least 3 groups - Kruskal-Wallis

```{r nonparametric_kruskal1}
stats::kruskal.test(tab$chao1 ~ Time, data = metadata)
```


Post hoc test: Dunn test (pairwise group test)
```{r nonparametric_kruskal2}
#install.packages("FSA")
signifgroup <- FSA::dunnTest(tab$chao1 ~ Type,
                           data = metadata,
                           method = "bh")
signifgroup
```

#### 1.1.5 Non-parametric (do not follows normal distribution) AND 2 groups - Wilcoxon rank sum

```{r nonparametric_wilcoxon}
tab_merged <- merge(rownames_to_column(tab, var = "Sample"), metadata)

pairwise_test <- ggpubr::compare_means( diversity_shannon ~ Gut,
                                        tab_merged,
                                       method = "wilcox.test")
pairwise_test
```

*ns= non-significant, *=p<0.05, **=p<0.01,  ***=p<0.001, ****=p<0.0001* 

**Q: What are your conclusions?**

Boxplot representation of the data


```{r boxplot, eval=FALSE}

graph_shan <- ggplot(metadata, aes(x = Gut, y = tab$chao1)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6, fill = c("#E7B800", "#00AFBB", "orange")) +
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = Type), 
              position = position_jitter(0.02), 
              cex = 2.2) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#a39715", "#04676e", "orange")) + # Manually set the colors
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 17, size = 3, color = "white") +
  theme_minimal() 

# Add p-value on graph
graph_shan + ggpubr::stat_pvalue_manual(
  pairwise_test,
  y.position = 3.5,
  label = "p.adj = {p.adj}",
  color = "blue",
  linetype = 1,
  tip.length = 0.01
)
```

![](https://github.com/vincentmanz/Metagenomics_2024/blob/main/Day_2/img/plot_wilco.png)

Alternative to plot the indexes: 

```{r index1}
plot_richness(merged_metagenomes, measures=c("Chao1", "Simpson"), color="Gut")
```

### 1.2 Linear regression

Determination coefficient R2 provides percentage variation in y which is explained by all the x together. Its value is (usually) between 0 and 1 and it indicates strength of Linear Regression model. Higher the R2 value, data points are less scattered so it is a good model. Lesser the R2 value is more scattered the data points.

```{r reg, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(tab_merged, aes(x = Number.of.days, y = chao1)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
  ggpmisc::stat_poly_eq(aes(label = paste(after_stat(rr.label),
                                          after_stat(p.value.label),
                                          sep = "*\", \"*"))) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](https://github.com/vincentmanz/Metagenomics_2024/blob/main/Day_2/img/chao.png)


**Q: try to interpret the results and re-run the regression for observed or shannon instead of chao1**

As a reminder, shannon measures the diversity within a sample, considering both richness and evenness. Chao1 is a measure of the total number of species in a sample, and it is based on the number of rare species in the sample.

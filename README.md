# Metagenomic course 2024


Microbial community structure, diversity, and population structure are fundamental aspects to understand evolution, niche adaptation and demographic history of bacterial species. As high-throughput sequencing has become cost effective and accessible, sequencing populations of bacteria across the whole metagenome provides unprecedented resolution to investigate within-host evolution, transmission history and population structure. Moreover, analysis of genetic content of microbial communities through metagenomics has become the mainstream methodology. During this three days course you will learn and apply bioinformatic techniques to perform population genetics and study microbial communities with metagenomic approaches. The goal is to become familiar with the bioinformatic analysis tools and to be able to utilize them in your own research after the course.

The course with be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises.
The course will be held in English.
The course unix server will be provided by the course organizers.
